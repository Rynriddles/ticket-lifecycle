When tickets come in, they can be assigned to a specific person or team. They are then responsible for making sure the ticket gets resolved.

The particular team or agent would then work through the ticket, working to resolve the issue in a timely manor depending on the severity level of the issue assigned to them making sure to maintain contact with the end user that requested help. Once the issue has been resolved, the agent is then able to close the ticket out.
